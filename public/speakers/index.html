  ## Zeynep Akata

  Zeynep Akata is a professor of Computer Science (W3) within the Cluster of
  Excellence Machine Learning at the University of Tübingen.  After completing
  her PhD at the INRIA Rhone Alpes with Prof Cordelia Schmid (2014), she
  worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for
  Informatics with Prof Bernt Schiele (2014-17) and at University of
  California Berkeley with Prof Trevor Darrell (2016-17). Before moving to
  Tübingen in October 2019, she was an assistant professor at the University
  of Amsterdam with Prof Max Welling (2017-19). She received a Lise-Meitner
  Award for Excellent Women in Computer Science from Max Planck Society in
  2014, a young scientist honour from the Werner-von-Siemens-Ring foundation
  in 2019 and an ERC-2019 Starting Grant from the European Commission. Her
  research interests include multimodal learning and explainable AI.

  ## Kristen Grauman

  Kristen Grauman is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the
  University of Texas at Austin and a Research Director in Facebook AI
  Research (FAIR).  Her research in computer vision and machine learning
  focuses on video, visual recognition, and action for perception or embodied
  AI.  Before joining UT-Austin in 2007, she received her Ph.D. at MIT.  She
  is an IEEE Fellow, AAAI Fellow, Sloan Fellow, a Microsoft Research New
  Faculty Fellow, and a recipient of NSF CAREER and ONR Young Investigator
  awards, the PAMI Young Researcher Award in 2013, the 2013 Computers and
  Thought Award from the International Joint Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence (IJCAI), the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and
  Engineers (PECASE) in 2013.  She was inducted into the UT Academy of
  Distinguished Teachers in 2017.  She and her collaborators have been
  recognized with several Best Paper awards in computer vision, including a
  2011 Marr Prize and a 2017 Helmholtz Prize (test of time award).  She served
  for six years as an Associate Editor-in-Chief for the Transactions on
  Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) and for ten years as an
  Editorial Board member for the International Journal of Computer Vision
  (IJCV).  She also served as a Program Chair of the IEEE Conference on
  Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2015 and a Program Chair of
  Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2018, and will serve as a
  Program Chair of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)
  2023.

  ## Paul Liang

  Paul Liang is a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at CMU, advised by
  Louis-Philippe Morency and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. His research lies in the
  foundations of multimodal machine learning with applications in socially
  intelligent AI, understanding human and machine intelligence, natural
  language processing, healthcare, and education. He is a recipient of the
  Facebook PhD Fellowship, Center for Machine Learning and Health Fellowship,
  and the Alan J. Perlis Graduate Student Teaching Award, and his research has
  been recognized by 3 best-paper awards at NeurIPS workshops and ICMI. He
  regularly organizes courses, workshops, and tutorials on multimodal machine
  learning.

  ## Arsha Nagrani

  Arsha Nagrani is a senior research scientist at Google AI Research, where
  she works on machine learning for video understanding. She got her PhD in
  the VGG group with Andrew Zisserman at the University of Oxford, supported
  by an EPSRC grant and a Google PhD Fellowship Award. Her thesis “Video
  Understanding using Multimodal Deep Learning” won the 2021 ELLIS PhD award.
  Her research focuses on self-supervised and multi-modal machine learning
  techniques for video recognition, including the use of sound and text to
  learn better visual representations.

  ## Siddharth Narayanaswamy

  Siddharth N. is a Reader in Explainable AI in the School of
  Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, a part-time Senior Research
  Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, a Visiting Fellow at the Department of
  Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, and an ELLIS Scholar. He
  was previously a Senior Researcher in Engineering at the University of
  Oxford and a Postdoctoral Scholar in Psychology at Stanford. He obtained his
  PhD from Purdue University in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
  His research interests are broadly cross-disciplinary and motivated by
  problems found at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision,
  natural-language processing, cognitive science, robotics, and neuroscience.
  In particular, he is interested in unsupervised learning of structured
  representations from perceptual data, and establishing common ground between
  machines and humans through interaction, with implications for building
  robust, generalisable, and interpretable AI and ML systems.
