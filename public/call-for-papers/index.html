    <h1 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h1>
<p>We will invite submissions (4-page papers, both technical and positional in nature) covering or bridging the following themes. We note that these themes are not mutually exclusive, and papers may touch on multiple
themes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Behavioral accounts</strong>. What kinds of generalizations have models learned about cognitively important
tasks? What kinds of cues, biases, or heuristics might affect a model’s performance on these tasks? What
kind of cognitive frameworks best characterize model behaviors?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ins>Example topics within scope:</ins> Hypothesis-driven evaluations of high-level cognitive behaviors; understanding how heuristics and task demands affect model behaviors; and fitting cognitive models to deep neural network behavioral data</li>
<li><ins>Example topics potentially out of scope:</ins> Evaluations of deep learning models which do not make claims about the underlying processes driving their behavior, or behavioral experiments with AI models which seek to further our understanding of the human mind, rather than our understanding of AI models</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Processing accounts</strong>. What algorithms underlie the behaviors models exhibit when performing key
high-level cognitive tasks? How are these algorithms implemented? How do these algorithms relate to
behaviors expected of a rational agent performing such tasks?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ins>Example topics within scope:</ins> Using interpretability tools to understand cognitive processing algorithms; explaining how heuristic strategies interact with rule-based generalization behaviors; and behavioral investigations of algorithms underlying complex tasks</li>
<li><ins>Example topics potentially out of scope:</ins> Design, validation, or demonstration of interpretability tools that are directed towards identifying or explaining narrow skills that are not instrumental towards performing complex tasks (e.g., work identifying neurons activating for prominent monuments), or not motivated towards explaining model cognition (e.g., work on identifying mechanisms to refuse unsafe queries by a model).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Learning accounts</strong>. How do certain cognitive abilities emerge or develop across learning? What properties of the training data distribution or objective functions contribute to downstream behaviors? How does the model’s training environment relate to predispositions supported by the model’s architecture or other forms of inductive bias? Relevant perspectives from cognitive science that could help shed light on these questions include developmental psychology, learning theory, and evolutionary biology.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><ins>Example topics within scope:</ins> Evaluations of learning inspired by cognitive theories; identifying models’ inductive biases; and understanding downstream effects of data distribution on behavior and generalization</li>
<li><ins>Example topics potentially out of scope:</ins> Developmental accounts that do not attempt to contextualize
cognitive theories or tools for understanding how neural networks learn their capabilities: e.g., work on
scaling laws or learning dynamics in the lazy regime.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>The submission will be open on OpenReview](<a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=neurips.cc/2025/Workshop/CogInterp">https://openreview.net/group?id=neurips.cc/2025/Workshop/CogInterp</a>) between July 5 and August 22, 2025 (midnight AoE). For all relevant dates, please see <a href="http://localhost:1313/neurips2025/#dates">Important Dates</a>. The formatting instructions are provided below.</p>
<p>Please note that it will be requested that at least one author of each submission participates in reviewing for the workshop.</p>
<h2 id="code-of-ethics-and-conduct">Code of Ethics and Conduct</h2>
<p>All participants of the workshop (including authors and reviewers) are required to adhere to the <a href="https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines">NeurIPS Code of Ethics</a> and <a href="https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct">NeurIPS Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="formatting-instructions">Formatting Instructions</h1>
<h2 id="style--author-instructions">Style &amp; Author Instructions</h2>
<p>Submissions should be formatted using the <a href="https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip">NeurIPS 2025 latex template and formatting instructions</a>. Papers must be submitted as a PDF file and there will be a strict upper limit of 4 pages for the main text, which should include all main results, figures, and tables. This page limit applies to both the initial and final camera-ready version. There is no page limit for the citations, and additional appendices for supplementary details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take the appendices into account.</p>
<h2 id="camera-ready-revisions">Camera-Ready Revisions</h2>
<p>Camera-ready revisions will be possible through OpenReview. While the workshop has no official proceedings (papers will be publicly available as <em>non-archival</em> reports through OpenReview), we strongly encourage authors to submit a revised &ldquo;camera-ready&rdquo; version taking reviewers&rsquo; comments and suggestions into account.</p>
<!-- We suggest uploading a revised version prior to the workshop, and possibly another final version (incorporating additional feedback from the poster session and workshop) one week after the workshop.  -->
