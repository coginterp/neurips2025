## Format

The workshop is part of NeurIPS and all attendees are requied to register for NeurIPS.

All talks, including the Panel Discussion, will be live-streamed virtually for those who are unable to attend in person.

<!-- 
virtual poster sessions will be run on <a href="https://gather.town/app/fdnUf3ZhiXnz0Eub/UAIsland2022">Gather Town</a> in parallel to the in-person ones**. The <a href="https://gather.town/app/fdnUf3ZhiXnz0Eub/UAIsland2022">Gather Town</a> platform will be the same as the one used for the main conference and the other UAI workshops. 
-->

<!-- There will be a single Zoom meeting for the whole day, which is accessible via ICLR 2023’s Zoom Events; if you are registered, you should have received information from the main conference on how to access the Zoom Events Lobby.

-->
<!-- It is allowed and encouraged to present posters both physically and virtually at the same time, e.g., if you have a co-author who will not attend in person and is willing to present online for the virtual participants.
